Groupon Commission Junction (CJ) Affiliate Plugin for WordPress.

== Description ==

Earn commission through your WordPress blog using the Groupon Affiliate Plugin for WordPress!  The Groupon for Wordpress Plugin utilizes the Wordpress Plugin architecture and the Groupon API in order to allow bloggers to easily post Groupon deals, complete with:

* Groupon-authored text and images
* Commission Junction integration
* User-configurable default locations (known as 'divisions')

 
By using the Wordpress Plugin architecture, the plugin allows users to configure their settings within the Wordpress administrative console.  These preferences include:

* Groupon API key (required for participation)
* Default division from which to pull Groupon deals
* Commission Junction PID (Publisher ID)
* Optional Commission Junction SID

 
These settings are stored within the Wordpress database along with settings for other Wordpress plugins.
 
The plugin adds a Groupon button to the rich text editor used when posting a blog.  Pressing the button pops up a window that allows the user to choose a specific deal to post about.  With just a few clicks, the image and description of the deal are pasted into the blog post while automatically linking through the Commission Junction affiliate system.
